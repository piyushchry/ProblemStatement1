# Step 1: Preprocessing
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Load the image and resize it to a consistent size
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
    image = image / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
    return image

# Step 2: Load a Pretrained GAN Model (e.g., DCGAN)
# You may need to adapt this part to your specific GAN model.
# Load the GAN model and weights

# Step 3: Create a Fake Image Detector Model
# You can use a pre-trained deep learning model like VGG16, Inception, or ResNet
# as the backbone for detecting fake images.

base_model = tf.keras.applications.VGG16(input_shape=(224, 224, 3),
                                         include_top=False,
                                         weights='imagenet')

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    base_model,
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Step 4: Compile the Model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 5: Prepare a Dataset
# You'll need a dataset containing both real and fake images for training.

# Step 6: Train the Model
# You can use data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques here.
# Train the model on your dataset.

# Step 7: Evaluate the Model
# Evaluate the model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance.

# Step 8: Make Predictions
# Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

# Example usage:
image_path = 'path_to_test_image.jpg'
test_image = preprocess_image(image_path)
prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(test_image, axis=0))

# Step 9: Interpret Results
# You can set a threshold to determine if an image is fake or real based on the prediction.

# Example threshold (adjust as needed)
threshold = 0.5
if prediction[0][0] > threshold:
    print("Fake image")
else:
    print("Real image")
