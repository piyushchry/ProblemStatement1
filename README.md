Title - Challenging Fake Image Detection using GAN Models
Detecting fake or manipulated images in today's digital age has become increasingly challenging due to the advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These AI-powered tools have made it easier than ever to create convincing fake images that can deceive both human observers and traditional image analysis techniques. The problem at hand is to develop a robust and effective fake image detection system that can differentiate between genuine and manipulated images generated by GAN models.

Objective: Develop a fake image detection system that can distinguish between real and AI generated images.
